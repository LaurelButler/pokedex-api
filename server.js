//this solution adds the validateBearerToken before each .get()
// app.get('/types', validateBearerToken, handleGetTypes);
// app.get('/pokemon', validateBearerToken, handleGetPokemon);

//this solution is only adding the validate middleware once and validating every request before it gets to the next handler middlewares:
// const app = express()
// app.use(morgan('dev'))
// app.use(validateBearerToken)
// app.get('/types', handleGetTypes);
// app.get('/pokemon', handleGetPokemon);
// app.listen(PORT, cb)
